## 🧩 Featured Projects

### 🔹 [Discord Bot](https://github.com/arzharch/Discord-Bot)
A multi-functional, agent-style Discord bot built to route tasks and respond intelligently using modern NLP techniques.
- Implemented **zero-shot classification** to categorize natural language input into actionable tasks like music playback, calendar reminders, and Q&A
- Integrated external services such as **Spotify**, **Google Calendar**, and web scraping for fallback question handling
- Designed a modular backend using **FastAPI**, ensuring maintainable and scalable code structure
- Experimented with **Mistral LLM** for JSON-based action generation and incorporated **Piper TTS** for voice responses, demonstrating agentic behavior

### 🔹 Fintelligence (Private Repository - will soon be made Public)
An AI-powered personal finance app designed as a full-stack capstone project.
- Built the backend using **FastAPI** and **Supabase**, with **JWT-based authentication** and a well-structured relational schema
- Developed a **custom neural network** to classify financial text input (e.g., “Paid 250 for groceries”) with ~99% accuracy across 10+ categories
- Implemented a **genetic algorithm** to rank mutual funds using multi-year NAV data and 26+ financial indicators
- Delivered a seamless user experience through a **React Native** front end, complete with dynamic visualization of budget analytics

### 🔹 [Face Recognition System](https://github.com/arzharch/face_rec)
A machine learning–based facial recognition pipeline combining modern detection and classification techniques.
- Used **SCR-based face detection** and generated **ArcFace embeddings** to represent facial features numerically
- Trained an **SVM classifier** to identify individuals from embedded vectors with high precision across labeled datasets
- Built reusable modules for embedding, training, and inference, enabling seamless integration into future projects
- Emphasized modularity and reproducibility while exploring real-world CV techniques in a backend-first implementation
